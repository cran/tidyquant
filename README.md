> Bringing financial analysis to the tidyverse

`tidyquant` integrates the best resources for collecting and analyzing financial data, `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and `PerformanceAnalytics`, with the tidy data infrastructure of the `tidyverse` allowing for seamless interaction between each. You can now perform complete financial analyses in the `tidyverse`.

Benefits
--------

-   **A few core functions with a lot of power**
-   **Integrates the quantitative analysis functionality of `zoo`, `xts`, `quantmod`, `TTR`, and *now* `PerformanceAnalytics`**
-   **Designed for modeling and scaling analyses using the the `tidyverse` tools in [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)**
-   **Implements `ggplot2` functionality for beautiful and meaningful financial visualizations**
-   **User-friendly documentation to get you up to speed quickly!**

One-Stop Shop for Serious Financial Analysis
