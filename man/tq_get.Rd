\title{Get quantitative data in \code{tibble} format}
\usage{
tq_get(x, get = "stock.prices", complete_cases = TRUE, ...)

tq_get_options()

tq_get_stock_index_options()
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single character string, a character vector or tibble representing a single (or multiple)
stock symbol, metal symbol, currency combination, FRED code, etc.}

\item{get}{A character string representing the type of data to get
for \code{x}. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"stock.prices"}: Get the open, high, low, close, volume and adjusted
stock prices for a stock symbol from
\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo Finance}.
\item \code{"financials"}: Get the income, balance sheet, and cash flow
financial statements for a stock symbol from
\href{https://www.google.com/finance}{Google Finance}.
\item \code{"key.ratios"}: These are key historical ratios. Get \strong{89 historical growth, profitablity, financial health,
efficiency, and valuation ratios that span 10-years} from
\href{https://www.morningstar.com}{Morningstar}.
\item \code{"key.stats"}: These are key current statistics. Get \strong{55 current key statistics} such as
Ask, Bid, Day's High, Day's Low, Last Trade Price, current P/E Ratio, EPS,
Market Cap, EPS Projected Current Year, EPS Projected Next Year and many more from
\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo Finance}.
\item \code{"dividends"}: Get the dividends for a stock symbol
from \href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo Finance}.
\item \code{"splits"}: Get the splits for a stock symbol
from \href{https://finance.yahoo.com/}{Yahoo Finance}.
\item \code{"economic.data"}: Get economic data from
\href{https://fred.stlouisfed.org/}{FRED}.
\item \code{"metal.prices"}: Get the metal prices from
\href{https://www.oanda.com/}{Oanda}.
\item \code{"exchange.rates"}: Get exchange rates from
\href{https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/}{Oanda}.
}}

\item{complete_cases}{Removes symbols that return an NA value due to an error with the get
call such as sending an incorrect symbol "XYZ" to get = "stock.prices". This is useful in
scaling so user does not need to
add an extra step to remove these rows. \code{TRUE} by default, and a warning
message is generated for any rows removed.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the appropriate \code{quantmod}
function. Common optional parameters include:
\itemize{
\item \code{from}: Optional. A character string representing a start date in
YYYY-MM-DD format. No effect on
\code{"financials"}, \code{"key.ratios"}, or \code{"key.stats"}.
\item \code{to}: A character string representing a end date in
YYYY-MM-DD format. No effect on
\code{get = "financials"},  \code{"key.ratios"}, or \code{"key.stats"}.
}}

\value{
Returns data in the form of a \code{tibble} object.

\description{
Get quantitative data in \code{tibble} format
}
\details{
\code{tq_get()} is a consolidated function that gets data from various
web sources. The function is a wrapper for several \code{quantmod}
functions. The results are always returned as a \code{tibble}. The advantages
are (1) only one function is needed for all data sources and (2) the function
can be seemlessly used with the tidyverse: \code{purrr}, \code{tidyr}, and
\code{dplyr} verbs.

\code{tq_get_options()} returns a list of valid \code{get} options you can
choose from.

\code{tq_get_stock_index_options()} Is deprecated and will be removed in the
next version. Please use \code{tq_index_options()} instead.
