> Functions that leverage the quantitative analysis functionality of `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod` and `TTR`

# Overview

There's a wide range of useful quantitative analysis functions that work with time-series objects. The problem is that many of these _wonderful_ functions don't work with data frames or the `tidyverse` workflow. That is until now! The `tidyquant` package integrates the most useful functions from the `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod` and `TTR` packages. This vignette focuses on the following _core functions_ to demonstrate how the integratation works with the quantitative finance packages:

* Transmute, `tq_transmute()`: Returns a new tidy data frame typically in a different periodicity than the input.
* Mutate, `tq_mutate()`: Adds columns to the existing tidy data frame.

# Prerequisites

Load the `tidyquant` package to get started.

```{r}
# Loads tidyquant, tidyverse, lubridate, xts, quantmod, TTR 
library(tidyquant)
```

# Function Compatibility

`tq_transmute_fun_options()` returns a list the __compatible mutate functions__ by each package. We'll discuss these options by package briefly.

```{r}
tq_transmute_fun_options() %>% str()
```

## zoo Functionality

```{r}
# Get zoo functions that work with tq_transmute and tq_mutate
tq_transmute_fun_options()$zoo
```

The `zoo` functions that are compatible are listed above. Generally speaking, these are the:

* Roll Apply Functions:
    * A generic function for applying a function to rolling margins.
    * Form: `rollapply(data, width, FUN, ..., by = 1, by.column = TRUE, fill = if (na.pad) NA, na.pad = FALSE, partial = FALSE, align = c("center", "left", "right"), coredata = TRUE)`.
    * Options include `rollmax`, `rollmean`, `rollmedian`, `rollsum`, etc.


## xts Functionality


```{r}
# Get xts functions that work with tq_transmute and tq_mutate
tq_transmute_fun_options()$xts
```

The `xts` functions that are compatible are listed above. Generally speaking, these are the:

* Period Apply Functions:
    * Apply a function to a time segment (e.g. `max`, `min`, `mean`, etc).
    * Form: `apply.daily(x, FUN, ...)`.
    * Options include apply.daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly.

* To-Period Functions:
    * Convert a time series to time series of lower periodicity (e.g. convert daily to monthly periodicity).
    * Form: `to.period(x, period = 'months', k = 1, indexAt, name = NULL, OHLC = TRUE, ...)`.
    * Options include to.minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly.
    * __Note 1 (Important)__: The return structure is different for `to.period` and the `to.monthly` (`to.weekly`, `to.quarterly`, etc) forms. `to.period` returns a date, while `to.months` returns a character MON YYYY. Best to use `to.period` if you want to work with time-series via `lubridate`.  
     
## quantmod Functionality

```{r}
# Get quantmod functions that work with tq_transmute and tq_mutate
tq_transmute_fun_options()$quantmod
```

The `quantmod` functions that are compatible are listed above. Generally speaking, these are the:

* Percentage Change (Delt) and Lag Functions
    * Delt: `Delt(x1, x2 = NULL, k = 0, type = c("arithmetic", "log"))`
        * Variations of Delt: ClCl, HiCl, LoCl, LoHi, OpCl, OpHi, OpLo, OpOp 
        * Form: `OpCl(OHLC)`
    * Lag: `Lag(x, k = 1)` / Next: `Next(x, k = 1)` (Can also use `dplyr::lag` and `dplyr::lead`)
    

* Period Return Functions: 
    * Get the arithmetic or logarithmic returns for various periodicity, which include daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.
    * Form: `periodReturn(x, period = 'monthly', subset = NULL, type = 'arithmetic', leading = TRUE, ...)`

* Series Functions: 
    * Return values that describe the series. Options include describing the increases/decreases, acceleration/deceleration, and hi/low.
    * Forms: `seriesHi(x)`, `seriesIncr(x, thresh = 0, diff. = 1L)`, `seriesAccel(x)`

## TTR Functionality

```{r}
# Get TTR functions that work with tq_transmute and tq_mutate
tq_transmute_fun_options()$TTR
```

# Quantitative Power In Action

We'll go through some examples, but first let's get some data. The `FANG` data set will be used which consists of stock prices for FB, AMZN, NFLX, and GOOG from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2016.

```{r}
data(FANG)
FANG
```

## Example 1: Use quantmod periodReturn to Convert Prices to Returns 

The `quantmod::periodReturn()` function generates returns by periodicity. We'll go through a couple usage cases.  

### Example 1A: Getting and Charting Annual Returns

We want to use the adjusted closing prices column (adjusted for stock splits, which can make it appear that a stock is performing poorly if a split is included). We set `ohlc_fun = Ad`. We research the `periodReturn` function, and we found that it accepts `type = "arithmetic"` and `period = "yearly"`, which returns the annual returns. 

```{r}
FANG_annual_returns <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun   = Ad, 
                 mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
                 period     = "yearly", 
                 type       = "arithmetic")
FANG_annual_returns
```

Charting annual returns is just a quick use of the `ggplot2` package.  

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
FANG_annual_returns %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = yearly.returns, fill = symbol)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    labs(title = "FANG: Annual Returns",
         subtitle = "Get annual returns quickly with tq_transmute!",
         y = "Annual Returns", x = "") + 
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2) +
    theme_tq() + 
    scale_fill_tq()
```



### Example 1B: Getting Daily Log Returns

Daily log returns follows a similar approach. Normally I go with a transmute function, `tq_transmute`, because the `periodReturn` function accepts different periodicity options, and anything other than daily will blow up a mutation. But, in our situation the period returns periodicity is the same as the stock prices periodicity (both daily), so we can use either. We want to use the adjusted closing prices column (adjusted for stock splits, which can make it appear that a stock is performing poorly if a split is included), so we set `ohlc_fun = Ad`. We researched the `periodReturn` function, and we found that it accepts `type = "log"` and `period = "daily"`, which returns the daily log returns. 


```{r}
FANG_daily_log_returns <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun   = Ad, 
                 mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
                 period     = "daily", 
                 type       = "log",
                 col_rename = "monthly.returns")
```

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
FANG_daily_log_returns %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = monthly.returns, fill = symbol)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "FANG: Charting the Daily Log Returns",
         x = "Monthly Returns", y = "Density") +
    theme_tq() +
    scale_fill_tq() + 
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2)
```


## Example 2: Use xts to.period to Change the Periodicity from Daily to Monthly

The `xts::to.period` function is used for periodicity aggregation (converting from a lower level periodicity to a higher level such as minutes to hours or months to years). Because we are seeking a return structure that is on a different time scale than the input (daily versus weekly), we need to use a transmute function. We select `tq_transmute` and pass the open, high, low, close and volume using OHLC format via `ohlc_fun = OHLCV`. Looking at the documentation for `to.period`, we see that it accepts a `period` argument that we can set to `"weeks"`. The result is the OHLCV data returned with the dates changed to one day per week.

```{r}
FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun = OHLCV, mutate_fun = to.period, period = "months")
```

A common usage case is to reduce the number of points to smooth time series plots. Let's check out difference between daily and monthly plots. 

### Without Periodicity Aggregation

```{r}
FANG_daily <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol)

FANG_daily %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted, color = symbol)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = "Daily Stock Prices",
         x = "", y = "Adjusted Prices", color = "") +
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    theme_tq() + 
    scale_color_tq()
```

### With Periodicity Aggregation

```{r}
FANG_monthly <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun = Ad, mutate_fun = to.period, period = "months")

FANG_monthly %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted, color = symbol)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = "Monthly Stock Prices",
         x = "", y = "Adjusted Prices", color = "") +
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    theme_tq() + 
    scale_color_tq()
```



## Example 3: Use TTR runCor to Visualize Rolling Correlations of Returns

Return correlations are a common way to analyze how closely an asset or portfolio mimics a baseline index or fund. We will need a set of returns for both the stocks and baseline. The stock will be the `FANG` data set and the baseline will be the Spdr XLK technology sector. We have the prices for the "FANG" stocks, so we use `tq_get` to retrieve the "XLK" prices. The returns can be calculated from the "adjusted" prices using the process in Example 1.

```{r}
# Asset Returns
FANG_returns_monthly <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun   = Ad, 
                 mutate_fun = periodReturn,
                 period = "monthly")

# Baseline Returns
baseline_returns_monthly <- "XLK" %>%
    tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
           from = "2013-01-01", 
           to   = "2016-12-31") %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun   = Ad, 
                 mutate_fun = periodReturn,
                 period = "monthly")
```

Next, join the asset returns with the baseline returns by date.

```{r}
returns_joined <- left_join(FANG_returns_monthly, 
                            baseline_returns_monthly,
                            by = "date")
returns_joined
```

The `TTR::runCor` function can be used to evaluate rolling correlations using the xy pattern. Looking at the documentation (`?runCor`), we can see that the arguments include `x` and `y` along with a few additional arguments including `n` for the width of the rolling correlation. Because the scale is monthly, we'll go with `n = 6` for a 6-month rolling correlation. The `col_rename` argument enables easy renaming of the output column(s).

```{r}
FANG_rolling_corr <- returns_joined %>%
    tq_transmute_xy(x = monthly.returns.x, 
                    y = monthly.returns.y,
                    mutate_fun = runCor,
                    n = 6,
                    col_rename = "rolling.corr.6")
```

And, we can plot the rolling correlations for the FANG stocks.

```{r}
FANG_rolling_corr %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = rolling.corr.6, color = symbol)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = "FANG: Six Month Rolling Correlation to XLK",
         x = "", y = "Correlation", color = "") +
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2) +
    theme_tq() + 
    scale_color_tq()
```



## Example 4: Use TTR MACD to Visualize Moving Average Convergence Divergence

In reviewing the available options in the `TTR` package, we see that `MACD` will get us the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). In researching the documentation, the return is in the same periodicity as the input and the functions work with OHLC functions, so we can use `tq_mutate()`. MACD requires a price, so we select close using `Cl`. 

```{r}
FANG_macd <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_mutate(ohlc_fun   = Cl, 
              mutate_fun = MACD, 
              nFast      = 12, 
              nSlow      = 26, 
              nSig       = 9, 
              maType     = SMA) %>%
    mutate(diff = macd - signal) %>%
    select(-(open:volume))
FANG_macd
```

And, we can visualize the data like so.

```{r}
FANG_macd %>%
    filter(date >= as_date("2016-10-01")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date)) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    geom_line(aes(y = macd, col = symbol)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = signal), color = "blue", linetype = 2) +
    geom_bar(aes(y = diff), stat = "identity", color = palette_light()[[1]]) +
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2, scale = "free_y") +
    labs(title = "FANG: Moving Average Convergence Divergence",
         y = "MACD", x = "", color = "") +
    theme_tq() +
    scale_color_tq()
```


## Example 5: Use xts apply.quarterly to Get the Max and Min Price for Each Quarter

The `xts::apply.quarterly()` function that is part of the period apply group can be used to apply functions by quarterly time segments. Because we are seeking a return structure that is on a different time scale than the input (quarterly versus daily), we need to use a transmute function. We select `tq_transmute` and pass the close price using OHLC format via `ohlc_fun = Cl`, and we send this subset of the data to the `apply.quarterly` function via the `mutate_fun` argument. Looking at the documentation for `apply.quarterly`, we see that we can pass a function to the argument, `FUN`. We want the maximum values, so we set `FUN = max`. The result is the quarters returned as a date and the maximum closing price during the quarter returned as a double. 

```{r}
FANG_max_by_qtr <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun   = Ad, 
                 mutate_fun = apply.quarterly, 
                 FUN        = max, 
                 col_rename = "max.close") %>%
    mutate(year.qtr = paste0(year(date), "-Q", quarter(date))) %>%
    select(-date)
FANG_max_by_qtr
```

The minimum each quarter can be retrieved in much the same way. The data frames can be joined using `left_join` to get the max and min by quarter.

```{r}
FANG_min_by_qtr <- FANG %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_transmute(ohlc_fun   = Ad, 
                 mutate_fun = apply.quarterly, 
                 FUN        = min, 
                 col_rename = "min.close") %>%
    mutate(year.qtr = paste0(year(date), "-Q", quarter(date))) %>%
    select(-date)

FANG_by_qtr <- left_join(FANG_max_by_qtr, FANG_min_by_qtr,
                         by = c("symbol"   = "symbol",
                                "year.qtr" = "year.qtr"))
FANG_by_qtr
```


And, we can visualize the data like so.

```{r}
FANG_by_qtr %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year.qtr, color = symbol)) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = year.qtr, y = min.close, yend = max.close),
                 size = 1) +
    geom_point(aes(y = max.close), size = 2) +
    geom_point(aes(y = min.close), size = 2) +
    facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2, scale = "free_y") +
    labs(title = "FANG: Min/Max Price By Quarter",
         y = "Stock Price", color = "") +
    theme_tq() +
    scale_color_tq() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
          axis.title.x = element_blank())
```
